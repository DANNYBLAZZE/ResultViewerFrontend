## Basic Management Portal 

# Frontend 

This is a basic management portal I implemented as part of my final year project at the University of Benin. This application supports two tenants; students and lecturers. 

The students can view their personal information in the profiie dashboard and check their results.

The lecturers can view their personal information in the profile dashboard, check the results of a student given their matriculation number and upload results to be added in the database from a csv file 

The url for the site is https://resultviewerfrontend.onrender.com

# Backend

The backend is made using express. The database in use is a postgres database hosted on the render.
